# m_arr
Dynamic array implementation. Didn't test it enough

I'm pretty sure there are cases where it doesn't work. For example if you don't use primitive types for the array

# How to use
Just include the header file.
```c
#include "m_arr.h"
```

It works with clang, haven't tested it with other compilers.

It compiles fine with this flags

```bash
-ansi -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Werror -pedantic -pedantic-errors
```
